{"message":"no just tell me weather iam selected or not ?and what is my total comp ?","response":"I'm afraid I'm a technical interviewer, not a hiring manager. I don't have the authority to make job offers or discuss compensation.\n\nHowever, I can give you some feedback on your performance during our mock interview. You didn't get a chance to showcase your technical skills or answer any questions, so it's difficult for me to assess your qualifications for a role.\n\nIf you'd like, we can conduct a mock interview and I can provide you with feedback on your performance. This will give you a better idea of your strengths and weaknesses, and help you prepare for future interviews."}
