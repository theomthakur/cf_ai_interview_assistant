{"message":"DONE","response":"You've completed the interview.  I'd like to summarize the key points and provide some feedback.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nUnfortunately, our conversation was very short. I didn't get a chance to ask you any technical questions or assess your problem-solving skills. If you're interested in continuing the interview, I'd be happy to start again.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nIn a real-world technical interview, the interviewer will typically ask a series of technical questions to assess your skills and experience. Our conversation was too brief to provide a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nIf you're interested in practicing for a technical interview, I can suggest some common interview questions and topics. We can also simulate a mock interview to help you prepare.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?"}
