# AI Prompts Used in Development

This document contains all AI prompts used during the development of this project.

## Initial Project Understanding
**Prompt**: "I need to build an AI-powered application on Cloudflare for a Software Engineer Intern application. The requirements are: LLM integration (Llama 3.3), workflow coordination, user input via chat/voice, and memory/state management. Can you help me understand the architecture and implementation?"

**AI Tool Used**: Claude Sonnet 4

## Architecture Design
**Prompt**: "Design a scalable architecture for a technical interview assistant using Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects for session state, Workers AI for LLM, and D1 for database. Include WebSocket support for real-time communication."

## Code Generation Prompts

### Worker Implementation
**Prompt**: "Generate a Cloudflare Worker using Hono framework that handles:
1. Session creation with Durable Objects
2. WebSocket connections for real-time chat
3. Integration with Workers AI (Llama 3.3)
4. KV storage for history
Include proper TypeScript types and error handling."

### Durable Object Session Manager
**Prompt**: "Create a Durable Object class for managing interview sessions with:
- WebSocket handling for multiple clients
- Message history storage
- State persistence
- Broadcasting to connected clients
- Automatic session cleanup"

### Frontend Components
**Prompt**: "Build a Next.js interview interface with:
- Real-time chat using WebSocket
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Message history with markdown support
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS"

### Database Schema
**Prompt**: "Design a SQL schema for D1 database to store:
- Interview questions by category
- User sessions and progress
- Performance analytics
Include indexes for optimal query performance"

## Debugging Assistance

### WebSocket Connection Issues
**Prompt**: "My WebSocket connection keeps disconnecting after 30 seconds in Cloudflare Workers. How do I implement keep-alive ping/pong?"

### AI Response Optimization
**Prompt**: "Optimize the system prompt for Llama 3.3 to act as a technical interviewer. It should ask relevant questions, provide hints, and give constructive feedback."

## Documentation
**Prompt**: "Create comprehensive README.md documentation for a Cloudflare AI project including:
- Feature list
- Architecture diagram
- Setup instructions
- Deployment guide
- Performance metrics"

## Testing Strategies
**Prompt**: "Suggest testing strategies for:
- WebSocket message handling
- Durable Object state persistence
- AI response quality
- Error handling scenarios"

## Performance Optimization
**Prompt**: "How to optimize Cloudflare Workers for:
- Reducing cold start latency
- Efficient KV storage usage
- Minimizing AI inference time
- WebSocket connection management"

## Security Considerations
**Prompt**: "What security measures should I implement for:
- User authentication (without external auth)
- Rate limiting API calls
- Sanitizing user input
- Protecting WebSocket connections"
